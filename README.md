Hey 👋, I'm Mohammed Adnan

Glad to see you here!
I’m a full-stack developer who has turned years of freelancing into a full-time career. Being a full-stack allows me to not only develop client-facing apps and websites but also develop it with cutting edge backend support.

I specialize in building robust backends that do all the heavy lifting for your app or website. I love designing systems that are light yet powerful, distributed yet synchronized and beautiful yet effective. I also frequently blog about the world behind the screen which involves system designs, databases, security, servers, optimisation and also promising technologies like Blockchain and PWAs.
